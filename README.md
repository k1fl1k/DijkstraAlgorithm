**Project: Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation**

**Description:**
This project is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in JavaScript. Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, particularly in scenarios where the edges have non-negative weights. The algorithm guarantees the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in the graph.

**Implementation Details:**
- Language: JavaScript (JS)
- Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Usage:**
To use this implementation, simply include the JavaScript file in your project or copy the code into your JavaScript environment. Then, you can call the function that implements Dijkstra's algorithm, passing the necessary parameters such as the graph and the source node.

Example Usage:
```javascript
// Include or define the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation

// Define your graph
const graph = {
  'A': { 'B': 4, 'C': 2 },
  'B': { 'A': 4, 'D': 5 },
  'C': { 'A': 2, 'D': 1 },
  'D': { 'B': 5, 'C': 1 }
};

// Specify the source node
const sourceNode = 'A';

// Call the Dijkstra's algorithm function
const shortestPaths = dijkstra(graph, sourceNode);

// Use the shortestPaths object as needed
console.log(shortestPaths);
```
